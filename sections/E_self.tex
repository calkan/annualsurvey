\begin{enumerate}

\item Evaluate your performance and achievements in the past year vis á vis your own goals. 

This year, I recived the TÜBİTAK Incentive Award.

I hired a new M.Sc. student, Can Fırtına. Also my M.Sc. student Marzieh Eslami Rasekh graduated, and enrolled to the Ph.D. program.

In 2015, I published 7 journal papers and 2 conference papers with proceedings with Bilkent affiliations. I also submitted two papers, which are under review.
I also presented one unpublished conference talk, and my students presented one unpublished conference talk, and 4 posters in international conferences.


\item Describe your goals pertaining to your work and your contributions to your department and the university in the next two years. 

I plan to use my grants to further my research in the area of bioinformatics and computational genomics. Here are my aims, listed for each grant:

\begin{enumerate}

\item NIH: I plan to continue working with Prof. Aykanat, and his PhD student Oğuz Selvitopi to continue our effforts to parallelize some of the bioinformatics tools. In a new collaboration with Assoc Prof Özcan Öztürk, we hired a new M.Sc. student (Azita Nouri) to continue the previous GPGPU work and develop algorithms for the new Tesla K20 GPGPUs that have a better memory layout and provide dynamic parallelism.
I also plan to continue our work on using FPGAs for the same purpose with my PhD student, Mohammmed Alser.
\item Marie Curie: Arda Söylev and Marzieh Eslami Rasekh will work in this project.
\item TÜBİTAK: I will continue advising my Ph.D. student (Fatma Kahveci), and my Ph.D. student at the Boğaziçi University (Pınar Kavak) for developing genome assembly and sequence correction algorithms and applying them to real datasets. In addition, Can Fırtına and Shatlyk Ashyralyev will work on algorithms based on hypergraphs and error correction for the same project.
\item EMBO: This project is the application of bioinformatic methods to genomic data for various purposes. I will continue collaborating with Dr. Mehmet Somel from the Middle East Technical Univeristy
on ancient DNA analysis and {\it de novo} sequencing of the {\it Chalcarburnus tarichi} genome.
