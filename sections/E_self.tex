\begin{enumerate}

\item Evaluate your performance and achievements in the past year vis á vis your own goals. 

This year, I was listed as one of the ``Highly Cited Researchers'' by the Thomson Reuters.

I hired two new PhD students, Handan Kulan and Mohammed Alser, and two M.Sc student, Gülfem Demir and Azita Nouri. I co-advise Azita with Özcan Öztürk.
 Also, another Ph.D. student, Arda Söylev, switched from Çiğdem Gündüz Demir's research group to mine.

In 2014, I published 8 papers with Bilkent affiliations, 1 of which is not yet in ISI since the journal (GigaScience) is new.

\item Describe your goals pertaining to your work and your contributions to your department and the university in the next two years. 

I plan to use my grants to further my research in the area of bioinformatics and computational genomics. Here are my aims, listed for each grant:

\begin{enumerate}

\item NIH: I plan to continue working with Prof. Aykanat, and his PhD student Oğuz Selvitopi to continue our effforts to parallelize some of the bioinformatics tools. In a new collaboration with Assoc Prof Özcan Öztürk, we hired a new M.Sc. student (Azita Nouri) to continue the previous GPGPU work and develop algorithms for the new Tesla K20 GPGPUs that have a better memory layout and provide dynamic parallelism.
\item Marie Curie: Arda Söylev will work in this project.
\item TÜBİTAK: I will continue advising my  M.Sc. student (Elif Dal), and one Ph.D. student at the Boğaziçi University (Pınar Kavak) for developing genome assembly and sequence correction algorithms and applying them to real datasets. In addition, Fatma Balcı and Shatlyk Ashyralyev will work on algorithms based on hypergraphs and distributed graph processing frameworks for the same project.
\item EMBO: This project is the application of bioinformatic methods to genomic data to discover gene 	  mutations that lead to obesity and diabetes. I will collaborate with Tayfun Özçelik and Ebru Erbay on   	  this project, and Volkan Yazar will be responsible of analyzing genomic data.
