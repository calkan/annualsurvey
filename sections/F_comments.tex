I think it is better if the faculty is relieved from evaluating internship reports that can be taken care of graders. 

It would also be helpful if the senior project supervision is organized like other courses in terms of quotas for each faculty member. Due to both student preferences, and faculty ``rejections'', the senior project supervision load is distributed unevenly. If there were a hard limit, like 2 or 3, for senior projects per faculty member, the project supervision will be better distributed. In its current form, some faculty (including myself) are overloaded. I have supervised 5 projects in 2013-14 and also in 2014-15: not by my choice, but because students either do not want to work with some faculty, or rejected by some others. 


Lastly, the non-research work load of the graduate students should be reduced; including required number of courses, and TAships.
